alright so you want to get your pesky, complicated, nested json into a nice clean csv format:

**step 1** - email your json file to `convert@hyperclone.com` with the fields you would like to retain.

**step 2** - wait for confirmation email, confirming your request and approving it. if theres something wrong our system will usually catch it at this step and we can fix it.

**step 3** - wait to get your csv file back.

if your json looks like this:

{% highlight text %}
{"name":"yan","age":52,"friends":[{"name":"jack","age":46},{"name":"katherine","age":33}]}
{"name":"joe","age":23,"friends":[{"name":"bethany","age":15,"fav_movie":"big lebowski"},{"name":"steve","age":46},{"name":"rich","age":50,"fav_show":"star trek"}]}
{% endhighlight %}

you could keep fields:

{% highlight text %}
name
friends.0.name
friends.0.age
friends.1.name
friends.1.age
friends.2.fav_show
friends.2.name
{% endhighlight %}

which would yeild a csv like:
{% highlight text %}
name,friends.0.name,friends.0.age,friends.1.name,friends.1.age,friends.2.fav_show,friends.2.name
yan,jack,46,katherine,33,,
joe,bethany,15,steve,46,"star trek",rich
{% endhighlight %}

a sample email would look like this:

{% highlight text %}
subject: conversion
fields:
name
friends.0.name
friends.0.age
friends.1.name
friends.1.age
friends.2.fav_show
friends.2.name
{% endhighlight %}

with your json file attached.
